# Flappy Bird

This is my version of the game Flappy Bird, created using Unity.

## Game Basis

This game was inspired by the classic game Flappy Bird. The goal of the game is to control a bird, flying between rows of pipes, and score as many points as possible.

## Libraries Used

In the process of creating this game, I used the following libraries:

- **Extenject**: A powerful dependency injection framework used to manage and organize code in a scalable way.
- **UniTask**: A library that provides a more efficient async/await for Unity. It was used to handle asynchronous operations in the game.
- **UniRx**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, which was used to simplify complex game logic and event handling.
